# 📊 LSTM Model for Financial Time Series Prediction

This project utilizes an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict financial time series data using TensorFlow and MetaTrader 5. The model is trained on historical data and evaluated for its performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical financial data from MetaTrader 5.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the data for training and testing.
- **Model Training**: Trains an LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model in .h5 format.
